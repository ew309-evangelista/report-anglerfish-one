We found the most important part of our design to be having zero steady state error, being able to aim confidently down a certain sighting. So, we determined our controller would have an integrator term. We decided our system must have under 5\% peak overshoot, and must have rise time of under \SI{0.5}{\second}, to ensure the system can quickly aim down a bearing very close to the actual target.

A PID controller was decided upon, to get initial gain values, $\omega_n$ and $\zeta$ were solved for using our desired transient response. From here gains were adjusted and tested with the stepinfo function until a desirable control response was reached. The control algorithm is as follows:
