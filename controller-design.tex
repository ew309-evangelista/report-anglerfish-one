\subsection{Controller design}

Block Diagram

We found the most important part of our design to be having zero steady state error, being able to aim confidently down a certain sighting. So, we determined our controller would have an integrator term. We decided our system must have under 5\% peak overshoot, and must have rise time of under \SI{0.5}{\second}, to ensure the system can quickly aim down a bearing very close to the actual target.
