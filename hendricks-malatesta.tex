\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The system must autonomously scan for, identify, and track discrete targets. Once a target is identified, the turret must center itself on target and, if the turret has a reasonable chance to hit the target, fire. The system must be able to distinguish between valid targets and those that should not be fired upon, and operate accordingly..
% suggestion guys the abstract would normally also say, as a quick summary, what all was achieved in the end. For this reason I often write
% the abstract as the very last thing... 
\end{abstract}

{\scriptsize \textbf{Keywords:} anglerfish, lophiiformes, buccal pumping, epibenthic, biomechanics, evolution}
% these are often used for automatic indexing and retrieval... fill in ones that make sense for you. 

\section{Introduction}
Test citation here \cite{buck2020go}.
\subsection{Problem statement}
Fill this in... 

% this next one should be the benchmarking, and wants to end with a table or something summarizing/comparing the existing design to your desired design
\input{background-research.tex} % If you prefer you can split your report into smaller files and input them this way... 

\subsection{Target design specifications}
Fill this in... this sets up what you are trying to achieve with your design. 


\section{System design}
\subsection{Functional block diagram}
Before launching into detailed technical discussions of each piece I would start with an overall broad brush picture of how it should work, establishing for the reader how each of the parts you will be discussing fits in the whole... I would most definitely add pictures here.
